Sorting algorithms are a fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. They are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. The efficiency of a sorting algorithm is often measured in terms of its time complexity, which is typically expressed using Big O notation.

Some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms include:

1. Bubble Sort: Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It repeats this process until the list is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.
2. Selection Sort: Selection sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.
3. Insertion Sort: Insertion sort builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.
4. Quick Sort: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list into two sublists: one containing elements less than the pivot and one containing elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.
